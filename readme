# Cypress Test Automation Framework

This project is a Cypress test automation framework using the Page Object Model (POM) and Keyword Driven Actions. It includes a setup for generating test reports using `mochawesome`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or extract the provided zip file**
2. **Install the dependencies**:
- npm install

## Running Tests

Setting up variables before running Cypress on your command:
$env:CYPRESS_ENV="QA";  # Set the environment
$env:CYPRESS_BASE_URL="https://automationexercise.com/"; # Set the base URL
$env:CYPRESS_ADMIN_EMAIL="erick@gmail.com"; # Admin email
$env:CYPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD="testing123";  # Admin password
$env:CYPRESS_TAGS="smoke,sanity"  # Only run tests tagged as smoke or sanity

export CYPRESS_ENV="QA";  # Set the environment
export CYPRESS_BASE_URL="https://automationexercise.com/"; # Set the base URL
export CYPRESS_ADMIN_EMAIL="erick@gmail.com"; # Admin email
export CYPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD="testing123";  # Admin password
export CYPRESS_TAGS="smoke,sanity"  # Only run tests tagged as smoke or sanity


Running Cypress Tests Visually
To open the Cypress Test Runner and run tests interactively:
- npm run cypress:open

Running Cypress Tests Headlessly
To run the tests headlessly and generate reports:
- npm run cypress:run

Generating the Report
After running the tests headlessly, generate the HTML report:
- npm run cypress:report
